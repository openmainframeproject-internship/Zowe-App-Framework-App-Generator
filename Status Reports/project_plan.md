**Project:**
Zowe App Generator

**Project Description:**
The Zowe App Generator is a plugin for the Zowe framework that creates boilerplate implementations of Angular, React, and iframe apps.

**Problem Definition:**
The Zowe App Generator makes it easier for a developer to quickly create apps for the Zowe framework without any specialized knowledge outside of modern web framworks. It is expected this will not only increase the speed of development, but will also encourage new development.

**Deliverables**
A properly documented application generator that will enable developers to create new boilerplate Angular, React, and iframe apps.
